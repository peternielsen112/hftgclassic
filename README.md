### About
Hope For the Galaxy Classic is a simplified version of the Pygame Zero game [Hope For The Galaxy](https://github.com/peternielsen112/hopeforthegalaxy). It's much smaller - about 14% of the size of the original game (in lines of code, [main.py](./main.py)). It also uses less images and has no music.
